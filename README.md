# Artist-Youtube-Dashboard
I built an artist Tableau Dashboard, data pulled from youtube using Youtube API and Youtube Analytics API and stored in PostgreSQL database on AWS-RDS

## **Project Components**
1.   Working with real data
2.   Working with modern Technologies (**API**s:'Youtube' &  **Databases in the cloud**: AWS Cloud)
3.   Building models
4.   Making an impact/ getting validation

**1. APIs: What to get**

1. ***Skills gained from working with an API***
 *   *Real time updates*
 *   *Date and timestamps for each record*
 *   *Geolocations*
 *   *Numbers and text for data analysis*


2. ***Skills gained from working with an API***
 *   *Setup and configure APIs (e.g dealing with API tokens*
 *   *Use Python libraries to make API calls*
 *   *Work with data structures like JSON and dictionaries to help collect and save data from the APIs*

**2. Databases in the cloud (Externsive Display of SQL skills)**
1. Building a pipeline to clean and add new records from API to database in the cloud
2. Building a data pipeline with a cloud provide like AWS or Google Cloud

**3. Building Models: Qs to Answer**
1. Why did you pick that model? 
 * What are you trying to accomplish with this model, that you can't with others?
2. How did you clean your data?
 * Why did you clean it that way?
3. What type of validation tests did you perform on the data to prepare it for the mode?
4. What are the assumptions of your model?
 * How did you validate those Assumptions?
5. How did you optimize your model?
 * What were the trade-off decisions that you made?
6. How did you implement your test/ control?
7. How does the underlying Maths in your model works?

**4. Building Models: Qs to Answer**
1. Put your code in ***github*** repos and data science sub-reddits
2. Create Visualizations in ***Tableau***
3. Share your Tableau Visualizations on ***Tableau Public***

## **Functions: Extracting of Data from YouTube API**
*   Use **Python Requests Library** to make an **API** Call
*   Make an API Call to **Youtube API**
*   Collect Data as **JSON**
*   Save Data into a Pandas dataframe

## **Functions: Extracting of Data from the YouTube Analytics API**

*   Use **Python Requests Library** to make an **API** Call
*   Make an API Call to **Youtube Analytics API**
*   Collect Data as **JSON**
*   Save Data into a Pandas dataframe

### **Main:** *YouTube API*
> * Main Calls for YouTube API
> *Python code for calling the youtube API
